## 📌 Overview

This 8-week capstone project focuses on **optimizing the inference of large-scale AI models** across diverse hardware environments. In enterprise AI, achieving **low latency**, **high throughput**, and **efficient resource utilization** is essential. Our solution addresses these challenges using cutting-edge inference strategies for **text**, **vision**, **audio**, and **multi-modal** AI models.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To enhance the **efficiency of AI model inference** by applying advanced optimization techniques—making large models viable in real-time, production-scale deployments across domains such as:

* Healthcare
* Finance
* Autonomous Systems

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

AI models are increasingly complex, outpacing the evolution of hardware infrastructure. The resulting bottlenecks include:

* ❌ High latency
* ❌ Excessive memory usage
* ❌ Suboptimal throughput

We aim to resolve these issues by optimizing inference through **quantization**, **continuous batching**, and **hardware-aware tuning**, ensuring a balance between **speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We used a blend of modern AI inference strategies:

### ✅ Quantization

Reduce model precision (e.g., **FP16**, **INT8**, **FP8**, **4-bit**) to decrease memory footprint and increase speed with negligible accuracy loss.

### ✅ Continuous Batching (vLLM)

Optimize handling of concurrent requests using dynamic batching to increase throughput and reduce response time.

### ✅ TensorRT Compilation

Leverage **NVIDIA’s TensorRT-LLM** for GPU-accelerated inference.

### ✅ Hardware-Aware Tuning

Deploy and optimize on:

* NVIDIA GPUs (A10G, A100, H100)
* AWS Inferentia (Neuron SDK)
* Amazon SageMaker endpoints
